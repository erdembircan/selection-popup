        I hear the drums echoing tonight
        <br>But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
        <br>She's coming in 12: 30 flight
        <br>The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
        <br>I stopped an old man along the way,
        <br>Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
        <br>He turned to me as if to say, Hurry boy, It's waiting there for you
        <br>
        <br>It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
        <br>There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
        <br>I bless the rains down in Africa
        <br>Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
